# spectro_lab
This is a first run at a lab for college juniors and seniors in a bioinstrumentation course. The objective is to understand spectrophotometry.

For future reference and laser prints, I have decided to call this Project Pocket Photon. It may change, but that is what we are on now.

Project Pocket Photon uses a plywood laser cut box (file to cut in repository) to house the portable spectrophotometry unit. The light source is a white LED, the diffraction grating is a DVD substrate, and the sensor is a photoresitor.
